    All I know about this for now is that we will have two endpoints. The (x, y) of the first endpoint will be
    where the user initially clicked to create the line. The second endpoints (x, y) will be set to wherever the user
    released the mouse click.

    EDIT: The above is just DLine I guess. This class is just the 'handles' I suppose
